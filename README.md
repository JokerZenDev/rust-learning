# Rust learning

## Introduction

I start learning Rust on the official Rust book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/. I use this repo to document my progress.

## Cargo commands

Most useful cargo commands are:
- cargo new <project_name>: to create a new project
- cargo build: to build your project and produce an executable
- cargo run: to build and run your project and produce an executable
- cargo check: to quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable
- cargo build --release: to compile your project with optimizations
- cargo add <crate_name>: to add a library crate as a dependency to your project
- cargo doc --open: to build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser
